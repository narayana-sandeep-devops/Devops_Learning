# Scenario 1 — 
Install Jenkins on an Ubuntu server and 
create your first Declarative Pipeline that checks out code from Git and produces an artifact

Real-time situation: You’ve been given a fresh Ubuntu VM (or cloud instance) 
and the dev team expects CI for their repo. Your first job is to install Jenkins, 
secure it minimally, create a pipeline job that checks out a simple repository and 
produces/archives an artifact so the team can see CI working.

Objective (what you’ll accomplish): Install Jenkins (systemd service), 
open the Jenkins web UI, unlock and configure basic plugins, create a pipeline that checks out 
code from Git (or a sample repo), runs a simple build step, and archives an artifact. 
You’ll also learn where to look for logs and common troubleshooting steps.

--> Prerequisites:--

You need sudo on the server, an instance with at least 2GB RAM (more is better), 
and internet access from that instance so Jenkins can download plugins and 
you can pull from a Git repo. I’ll show Ubuntu commands.

--> Step-by-step (follow these on the server / Jenkins UI

Step 1:
    - Install Java (Jenkins runtime): Jenkins requires Java. 
    On Ubuntu run this to install OpenJDK 11 and verify it.
        * sudo apt update
        * sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
        * java -version
    - Expect a Java 11 output. If java is missing, the pipeline agents will fail when running shell steps.

Step 2:
    - Add Jenkins apt repo and install Jenkins: (modern, commonly used approach)
        * curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
        /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

        * echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
          https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | \
          sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list

        * sudo apt update
        * sudo apt install -y jenkins
    - After install start/enable the service:
        * sudo systemctl start jenkins
        * sudo systemctl enable jenkins
        * sudo systemctl status jenkins
