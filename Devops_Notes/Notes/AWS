<===============================================>
AWS:
Cloud Computing:
    - 
-- Deployment and Cloud Services:
    - Public Cloud
        - Shared resources open to everyone
    - Private Cloud
        - Dedicated resources of organization
    - Hybrid Cloud
        - A mix of public and Private
-- Cloud Service Model
    - There are 3 main types of service models of cloud computing. Each type of cloud 
    computing provides levels of control, flexibility and management so that 
    you'll select the proper set of services for your needs.
        * IAAS
        * PASS
        * SAAS
            - Subscription basis
            ex: Amazon Workspace
-- Virtualization and Hypervisors
    - Types of Virtualization
        * Hardware      -   Virtualizes computer hardware components
        * Storage       -   Aggregates storage into virtual pool.
        * Network       -   Combines multiple networks into one.
        * Server        -   Multiple Servers on one.
        * Application   -   Runs apps independently of OS
    -  Steps of Virtualization
        * Disaster Recovery
        * Isolation
        * flexibility
        * Resource Efficiency
        * Cost Savings
        * Faster Provisioning
    - Hypervisor:
        * A hypervisor is a software that enables multiple operating systems to run on a single 
        physical machine simaltanueously. It created and manages virtual machines, allowing 
        efficient resource utlization and Isolation of different computing envrionments on 
        the same hardware.
        * Types of Hyper visors.
            - Type - 1 (bare metal)
            - Type - 2 ( Hosted)
    - virtualization in AWS
        * AWS achieves virtualization using XEN hypervisor. Every AWS AMI uses the bare metal
        Xen Hypervisor. Xen offers 2 types of virtualization
            - HVM (Hardware Virtual machine)
            - PV (Paravirtualization) Efficiency

 -- AWS Suite (With Analogy)
    - Storage (S3, EBS)
    - Network (VPC)
    - Databases (RDS)
    - Compute (EC2)
    - Monitoring (CloudWatch)
    - Machine Learning

-- AWS Well-Architectured Framework
    - This Architecture build up on 6 major pillars
        * Operational Excellence
            - The operrational excellence pillar is about able to effectively support and
            run workloads, understand how they operate, and continusouly improve processos to 
            deliver business value.
            - It provides guidance on best practices and design principles for achieving these goals,
            focusing on areas such as DevOps practices, infrastructure as Code, automation, and 
            observability.
            - The operational excellence pillar provides an overview of design principles, 
            best practices, and questions.

        * Cost Optimization
            - The Cose Optimization pillar in AWS is about systems to deliver business value
            to the lowest possible cost.
            - The cost Optimization pillar is one of the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected 
            Framework, which helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and 
            efficient infrastructre for their applications.
        
        * Reliability
            - The Reliability pillar in AWS is about ensuring that a workload can consistently 
            perform its intended function and can be operated ant tested throughut its entire 
            lifecycle. It provides detailed guidance on best pracitces for implementing 
            reliable workloads on AWS.
            - The pillar emphasizes the importance odf strong foundations, resilient architecture, 
            consistent change management, and proven failure recovery processes.

        * Performance Efficiency
                - The Performance Efficiency pillar in the AWS Well-Architected Framework focuses
                on using computing resources effiently to meet system requriements and maintaining
                that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
                - The pillar emphasizes the efficient use of computing resources, the selection
                of the best performing architecture, and the use of advanced tachnolgies such as 
                serverless architectures and machine learning to improve performance.

        * Security
            - The security pillar of AWS is about protecting data, systems and assets using cloud 
            technologies to enhance security.
            - It provides guidance on best preactices and design principles for achieving these 
            goals, focusing on areas such as strong identity management, infrastructure protection,
            and preparation for security events.
            - The Security pillar includes seven design priciples for security in the cloud. 
            such as implementing a strong identity foundation, enability tracebility, and 
            applying security at all layers.

        * Sustainability
                - The Sustainability pillar in the Well-Architected Framework socuses on minimizing
                the envrionmental impacts of running cloud workloads, particulaly in terms of 
                energy consumption and efficiency.
                - It provides guidance on a shared responsibility model for sustainability, 
                understanding impact, maximinisizing usage to minize required resources, and reducing 
                downstream impacts.
                - The pillar emphzsizes the imporatnace of making informed decisions to balance security,
                cost, performance, reliability, and operational excellence with sustainability outcomes
                for workloads on AWS.
