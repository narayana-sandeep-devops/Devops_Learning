--> Docker

- cloud Hypervisor is called - Xen/Nitro
- Containers package an application and its dependecies together, making the application easily runnable on any system that has Docker installed

Note: By Default Docker works with the root user and other users can only access to Docker with sudo commands. However, 
we can bypass the sudo commands by creating a new group with the name docker ad add ec2_user.

    * sudo groupadd docker
    * sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    * newgrp docker
    * sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

--> Default location
    * docker version            --> To check the version in machine
    * docker --version          --> To check both client and server status
    * docker pull <image>       --> to downloa the image from docker hub
    * docker run -dt <image>
    * docker run -dt --name <container-Name> <image>
    * docker ps 
    * docker ps -a 
    * docker run -dt -p <localhost-port>:<container-port> <image_name>
    * docker run -dt --name <container-name> -p source-port:container-port <image>
    * docker inspect image nginx   ## to check image details
    * docker ps -a | grep Exit    ## To check only stopped Containers

--> docker attach
    - docker attach <container-id>
    - CTRL + P & CTRL + Q  #use this to exit from container terminal without stopping container.
 
-- To login into the container
    * docker exec -it <container-id/name> /bin/bash

*****  EXIT[0] About a minut ago
    - If a container crashed, exit code help debug why
    - 0 = stopped manually
    - Non-Zero = Crashed or has an error.
    - Exited (137) → Out of memory or forced stop
    - Exited (1)   → App crash or command failed

--> Conatiner usage command: 
    - docker stats <container-id  # View live resource usage


--> Dockerfile Instructions:
    - by using docker file we can pass the Instructions
    - 

    * FROM          -- To Pull image from docker hub (UBUNTU/centos)
    * RUN           -- apt-get update -y  (locally executable commands)
    * RUN           -- mkdir test
    * WORKDIR       -- works like CD command
    * COPY          -- Copy the files from local to docker
    * ADD           -- works like copy instructions, we can add here URL's also , we can call from remote locations
    * EXPOSE        -- Default port number of application
    * CMD           -- Executable command in container
    * ENTRYPOINT    -- Same like CMD executable command in container but here we can't change commands
                    while docker run time.
    * USER          --
    * VOLUME        --

--> Image building
    - docker build -t test .

--> Push image to remote resigtry (Dockerhub, ECR)

=================================>

-- important points
- if a container is created from image and it is not possible to delete the container. even if container
is in stopped state as well
- detach vs interactive
    - You use interactive mode for testing, debugging, or manually inspecting containers.
    - detach mode (-d) Runs in background
    - interactive mode (-it) allows to access shell in container for typing commands.
