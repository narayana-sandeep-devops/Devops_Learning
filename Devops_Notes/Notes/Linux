Linux For Devops


- Linux is operating system
- Advantages of Linux:
    - Open Source
    - High Security
    - Strong Kernal system
    - Light weight
    - Fast Response
    - Poratability
    - multitasking
    - Automation

  - Founder: Linus Torvalds
  - Kernel:
    - Kernal is a heart of the OS
    - Kernal do hardware management
    - Kernal is interface between application program and hardware
  - Shell:
    - interface between user and Kernal
    - command (yum install httpd -y) -- shell -- kernal -- hardware
    - what ever commands we are going to run it will give to shell and shell redirecting into kernal
     and redirectes to hardware.
  - utilities:
    - Pre installed libraries and binaries are stored here

- File system

| Directory    | What It Contains          | DevOps Use                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **/**        | Root directory            | Starting point of everything             |
| **/home**    | Normal user data          | Store project files, configs             |
| **/root**    | Root user home            | Admin operations                         |
| **/etc**     | **Configuration files**   | Most DevOps configs (nginx, ssh, docker) |
| **/var**     | Logs, cache, runtime data | **DevOps log troubleshooting**           |
| **/usr/bin** | Installed commands        | Tools location                           |
| **/bin**     | Basic commands            | ls, cp, mv, rm, cat                      |
| **/sbin**    | Admin commands            | systemctl, service                       |
| **/tmp**     | Temporary files           | Short-lived operations                   |
| **/opt**     | Optional applications     | Jenkins, java installs                   |

- commands
   - sudo su - to switch root user
   - ls - list files
   - su -   --> to switch to user 
   - su - <username>
   - cd~  -> this is a short cut command to go to user home page
   - touch file1   -> it creates a file1
   - mkdir folder1  -> it creates a folder1
   - rm --- to remove file/folder/directory
   - s
