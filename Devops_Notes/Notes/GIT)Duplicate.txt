=====> GIT:
- GIT is used to track the files.
- It will maintain multiple versions of the same file.
- It is platform-independent.
- It is free and open-source.
- They can handle larger projects eficiently.
- It is 3rd generation of vcs.
- It is written on C Programming.
- It came on the year 2005


* CVCS : Centralised Version control system
  - Stores code on single Repo.
  - ex: SVN

* DVCS : Distributed Version Control System
  - Stores code on multiple repos.
  - ex: GIT

--> Why GIT: to store each version of code seperately.
  Purpose: To Rollback
  Rollback means going back to previous version of the application
  v2 <-- V3

--> STAGES OF GIT:
- Working Directory   :   Where we write the code
- Staging Area        :   Where we track the code
- Repository          :   Where we atore the tracked code

--> Practical Part:

1. Create a Server and Login into it
  - sudio -i
  - mkdir git
  - cd git 

2. Install GIT
  - yum install git 
  - git init (without git init, we cant run git commands)

3. Working with GIT
  - touch index.html (once you create a file, it will be in working area)
  - git status : to check status of a file
  - git add index.html : to track the file (move to staging area)
  - git commit -m "commit -1"  : to commit the file (move to Repository)
  - git log 
  - git log --oneline   : it shows commits history in single line
  - git log --oneline -2 : it shows last 2 commits history
  - git show commit_id   : to show which file is commited for this id.
  - git status           : to show the current status of files

--> User Configuration:
  - By default all the commits will come with defaults user.
  - So we need to change the username as per our requirement
    - git config user.name "Sandeep Narayana"
    - git config user.email "sandeep.narayana@outlook.com"

-->  GIT RESTORE:
- This command will untrack the tracked files.
- unfortunately you track any file and want to untrack the file.
   * git restore --staged <file_name>
   * git rm --cached <file_name>
- This command also used to recover the deleted file.
   * git restore <file_name>

--> GIT STASH   (Stash means hidding)
  - To hide the tracked files for temporary purpose.
  - git stash           : to stash the file
  - git stash apply     : to unstash the file
  - git stash list      : to list the stashes
  - git stash clear     : to clear the stash


--> BRANCHES:
- It's an individual line of development for code.
- We create different branches in real-time.
- Each developer will work on their own branch.
- At the end we will combine all together.
- Default branch is Master.

  * git branch                    : to list the branches
  * git branch <branch-name>      : to create a new branch
  * git checkout <branch-name>    : to switch between the branches
  * git checkout -b <branch_name> : to create and switch from one branch to another
  * git branch -D <branch_Name>   : to delete the branch
  * git branch -m <old_name> <new_branch_Name> : To rename the branch


--> Creating GITHUB account:
Note: in github passwords are not accepted, we need to use token

Profile --> Settings --> developer settings --> Personal access token --> classic
generate new token --> classic --> name: <token_name>  --> select 6 scopes --> generate

* touch file1.txt
* git add file1.txt
* git commit -m "Commit-1"
* git branch -M main
* git remote add origin https://github.com/narayana-sandeep-devops/devops_practice.git
* git push -u origin main


--> GIT clone
- it download code from github(remote) to git (local), by using the git clone.
- git clone <link>

--> GIT FORK:
- it download code from one account to another 

- For git clone and git fork repos must be public.


--> GIT merge
- It will merge the files between branches

--> GIT Rebase:
- Used to add files between 2 different branches
  * git checkout Master
  * git rebase train
  * git rebase recharge

  --> MERGE VS Rebase
  - Merge for public repos, rebase for private
  - Merge stores history, rebase will not share the entire history
  - Merge will show files, rebase will not show files

  --> PULL Request (PR)
  - in GITHUB we use pull Request (PR) to do merging.

--> GIT Revert
- Used to revert (get back) the files we merge.
  * git revert dth
  * git revert recharge 

--> GIT pull
- it will take the files from github to git (local)
- to get the latest changes from remote to local

  * git pull origin Master

--> GIT fetch
- used to show the changed files from github to git.

  * git fetch

--> CHERRY-PICK
- Merging the spefici files based on commits.
  * git cherry-pick <commit-id>
-step-by-step Process:
  * mkdir test1
  * cd test1/
  * touch java{1..3}
  * git init
  * git add java*
  * git commit -m "java-commits" java*
  * git branch
  * git checkout -b branch1
  * touch python{1..5}
  * git add python*
  * git commit "commit python" python*
  * touch php{1..5}
  * git add php*
  * git commit -m "php commits" php*
  * touch dotnet{1..5}
  * git add dotnet*
  * git commit -m "dotnet commits" dotnet*
  * git log --oneline
  * git cherry-pick <commit-id>

--> MERGE Conflict
- 

--> .gitignore
- This file will ignore the files of being tracked.
- if you write any filename on this .gitignore it wont track the file.
note: .should be mandatory


--> GIT RESET:
- to undo the commits.

--> Branching Strategy:
- LONG LIVING BRANCHES: these branches we wont delete and we use them frequently
- ex: Master, Main
- SHORT LIVING BRANCHES: these branches we will delete and we dont use them frequently
- eg: release, bugfix..
