        * DVS (Distributed Version Control)
        * CVS (CVS (Centeralized Version Control)
    - Git Installation Process
    - Staging Area, working area
    - Git Global Configurations
        - git config --global.username "your-name"      # to Configure username into git
        - gir config --global.email "email-id"          # to configure email into git

    - git add .     # to add files from working directory to staging area
    - git commit -m ""      # to add files staging area to local repository 
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/narayana-sandeep-devops/git-demo.git     # add remtoe repository in exisiting folder with files 
    - git push origin main  # to push the changes from local respository to remote

    -  Git hub is remote respository where we are going to maintain our source code.
    - here we have 2 types of respositories we can create
        1. Public
        2. Private
    - Git Clone: 
        * HTTPS
        * SSH

    - Generating keys in linux machine
    - Go to .ssh/
    - type " ssh-keygen"
    - it will create 2 file "id_rsa" "id_rsa.pub"
    
    - git log

    - Token creation Process
        * settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access -> create token
        * git remote set-url origin https://<token>/<repository>.git
    - Check config file in local laptop
        - cd .git
        - cat config
        - it if available the content about you origin, branches etc
    - git remote -v

    - MAP LOCAL REPO TO REMOTE REPOSITORY
        - echo "#check" >> README.md
        - git init
        - git add README.md
        - git commit -m "first commit"
        - git branch -M main
        - git remote add origin <link>
        - git push --set-upstream origin main
        - git push -u origin main

    - git restore <file name>
    - git restore --stage 
    - git reset head~1   - dicard changes from local to working directory
    
    - git diff   --- compare changes local directory to staging area
    - git diff --staged     - compare changes staging to local repo
    - git diff head       -----compare changes local direcotry to local repo

    - git diff commit id to commit id    ---- compare changes in to two commits.

    - Branches:
        - it's an individual process of development for code. we create individual branch in real-time to do test and develope.
        - Each developer will work on their own branch. At the end we will merge all branches into actual branch.
        - Default branch is Master(Main)

        - git branch                        -- to list the branches,
        - git branch dev                    -- to create a new branch
        - git checkot dev                   -- to switch from one branch to another.
        - git checkout -b dev               -- to create and switch from one branch to another.
        - git branch -m oldname newname     -- to rename a branch
        - git branch -D dev                 -- to delete a branch
