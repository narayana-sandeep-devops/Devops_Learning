-- What is MLOPS?
- MLOPS (Machine Learning Operations) is the discipline of combines MAchine Learning (ML) 
with DevOps practices to streamline and automate the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning models. 
It focuses on collaboration, integration, and continuous delivery of ML models 
in production environments.
- MLOPS bridges the gap between data science and IT operations, enabling organizations to deploy, monitor, and manage ML models effectively. 
- MLOPS encompasses various aspects, including data preparation, model training, model deployment, 
monitoring, and governance.
- MLOPS aims to improve the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of ML model deployment,
ensuring that models deliver consistent and accurate results in real-world applications.

--> Pupose of MLOPS: Make ML models Production-ready, continously improving, and scalable.
- The purpose of MLOPS is to streamline and automate the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning models,
from development to deployment and monitoring.
- Repidly deploy and Monitor ML Models in production environments.
- Automate retraining based on new data or performance degradation.
- Ensure compliance, auditability and version control of models and data.
- Facilitate collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and Devops Engineers.

--> REal-Worl imporatance:
- in enterprise like Netflix, Uber, Amazom, Google thousands of ML models are deployed every week.
- Without MLOPS, manual management causes:
    - Model Drift
    - Version Choas
    - Data Leakage
    - Deployment Failures
    - Scalability Issues
    - Security Vulnerabilities
    - Compliance Risks
    - Collaboration Breakdowns
    - Inefficient Resource Utilization
    - Delayed Time-to-Market
    - Increased Operational Costs
    - Reduced Model Performance

  --> Evolution: DEVOPS -> DataOps -> MLOPS
  DEVOPS -> Focus on Software Build, test, deploy automation -> Tools Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes -> Out come - Faster app delivery
  DataOps -> Focus on Data Pipeline automation, data quality -> Tools Airflow, kafka, dbt -> Out come - Reliable data flow
  MLOPS -> Focus on End-to-End ML lifecycle automation -> Tools MLflow, Kubeflow, sagemaker -> Outcome - Reliable model delivery

  -->Core MLOPS LifeCycle Phases:
  - Data Collection & Validation: Ensure high-quality, labeled and consistent data
  - Feature Engineering: Transform raw data into meaningful features
  - Model Training & Experimetal Tracking - Track metrics using MLflow, W&B
  - Model Packaging: Containerize models with Docker
  - Model Deployment: Deploy via REST, gRPC, or batch systems
  - Monitoring & Drift Detection - Track performance degradation
  - Continous Training - Automate retraining Pipelines

--> MLOPS Architecture Layers:
- Data Layer: Data Sources, Pipelines, Sotrage (S3, BigQuery, Snowflake)
- Model Layer: Training, experiment tracking, versioning (MLflow, sagemaker)
- Deployment Layer: Serving infrastructure, CI/CD (Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins)
- Monitoring Layer: Performance tracking, alerting (Prometheus, Grafana), Model Drift Detection

-> Key MLOPS Principles:
- Automation: Automate data pipelines, model training, deployment, and monitoring.
- Versioning: Track versions of data, code, and models for reproducibility.
- Collaboration: Foster teamwork between data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps.
- Scalability: Design systems to handle growing data and model complexity.
- Monitoring: Continuously monitor model performance and data quality in production.
- Governance: Ensure compliance with regulations and ethical standards.

--> Hands-on Labs
 - Goal: Buiild a mini MLOPS Pipeline
  Step 1: Tain ML Model
  Step 2: Track the MLflow
  Step 3: Containrize with Docker
  Step 4: Deploy & Monitor 

--> Production MLOPS Setup
 - Data Engineers manage ETL and feature pipelines (Airflow, spark)
 - ML Engineers develop, train, and validate models (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Sagemaker)
 - DevOps Engineers handle deployment, scaling, and monitoring (Kubernetes, Prometheus)
 - Monitoring Teams use Prometheus, Grafana and eveidently AI for drift Detection
 - Automation triggers retraining workflows through Airflows DAGs or GitHub Actions.

-- Prerequisites for MLOPS for DevOps Engineers Course:
- Basic understanding of Machine Learning concepts and workflows.
- Familiarity with DevOps practices, tools, and methodologies.
- Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
