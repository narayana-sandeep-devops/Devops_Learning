MLOPS Zero TO HERO Course:


-- MLOPS is the discipline that combines MAchines Learning, DevOps and Data Engineering
-- It aims to deploy and maintain ML models in production reliably and efficiently.
-- MLOPS is a collaborative function that involves data scientists, DevOps engineers and IT professionals.
-- Key Components of MLOPS:
    1. Version Control: Using tools like Git to manage code and model versions.
    2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automating the testing and deployment of ML models.
    3. Monitoring: Tracking model performance and data drift in production.
    4. Data Management: Ensuring data quality, lineage, and governance.
    5. Collaboration: Facilitating communication between data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders.
-- Popular MLOPS Tools:
    1. MLflow: An open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
    2. Kubeflow: A Kubernetes-native platform for deploying, scaling, and managing ML workloads.
    3. TensorFlow Extended (TFX): An end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines.
    4. DVC (Data Version Control): A version control system for managing ML projects and datasets.
    5. Seldon: An open-source platform for deploying and scaling ML models on Kubernetes.
-- Benefits of MLOPS:   
    1. Faster Model Deployment: Streamlines the process of getting models into production.
    2. Improved Collaboration: Enhances teamwork between data scientists and engineers.
    3. Better Model Performance: Enables continuous monitoring and updating of models.
    4. Scalability: Facilitates the handling of large-scale ML workloads.
    5. Reproducibility: Ensures that experiments and results can be consistently reproduced.
-- Challenges in MLOPS:
    1. Complexity: Integrating various tools and processes can be complex.
    2. Data Management: Handling large volumes of data and ensuring its quality.
    3. Model Monitoring: Continuously tracking model performance and addressing issues.
    4. Skill Gaps: Requires expertise in both ML and DevOps practices.
-- Future of MLOPS:
    1. Increased Automation: More automated tools and processes for ML lifecycle management.
    2. Integration with AI: Closer integration with AI technologies for enhanced capabilities.
    3. Focus on Ethics: Greater emphasis on ethical considerations in ML deployment.
    4. Expansion of Tools: Development of new tools and platforms to support MLOPS practices.
-- Conclusion:
    MLOPS is a critical discipline for organizations looking to leverage machine learning effectively. By combining best practices from DevOps and data engineering, MLOPS enables the reliable deployment and maintenance of ML models in production environments.
