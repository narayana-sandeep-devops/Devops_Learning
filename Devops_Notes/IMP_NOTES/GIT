100 MUST-REMEMBER GIT POINTS FOR DEVOPS ENGINEERS
🔹 Git Basics
1.	Git is a distributed version control system used to track code changes.
2.	Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code safely.
3.	Every developer has a full copy of the repository locally.
4.	Git tracks changes using commits, not file versions.
5.	Each commit represents a snapshot of the project at a point in time.
6.	Git helps roll back code to previous stable versions.
7.	Git is mandatory for CI/CD pipelines.
8.	Git works locally without internet once repository is cloned.
9.	Git stores history efficiently using hashes.
10.	Git is faster than centralized version control systems.

🔹 Repository & Setup
11.	Repository is a directory where Git tracks files and history.
12.	git init creates a new Git repository locally.
13.	git clone copies a remote repository to local machine.
14.	.git directory stores complete repository metadata.
15.	Deleting .git removes version control from project.
16.	Git repositories can be local or remote.
17.	GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket are popular remote Git platforms.
18.	Remote repositories enable team collaboration.
19.	Each repository has branches and commit history.
20.	Repository structure must be clean for maintainability.

🔹 Working Directory & Staging
21.	Working directory contains actual project files.
22.	Git tracks only files added to repository.
23.	git status shows file states clearly.
24.	Staging area prepares files before commit.
25.	git add moves changes to staging area.
26.	Staging allows reviewing changes before commit.
27.	Untracked files are not yet added to Git.
28.	Modified files are tracked but changed.
29.	Staged files are ready for commit.
30.	Clean staging reduces mistakes.

🔹 Commits
31.	Commit saves staged changes permanently in Git history.
32.	git commit creates a new snapshot.
33.	Commit messages should be clear and meaningful.
34.	Small commits are easier to review and revert.
35.	Each commit has unique SHA hash.
36.	Commits should represent logical changes.
37.	Avoid committing broken code.
38.	Commits enable traceability and auditing.
39.	Good commit history improves debugging.
40.	CI pipelines trigger based on commits.
________________________________________
🔹 Branching
41.	Branch is an independent line of development.
42.	main or master is the default branch.
43.	Feature branches isolate new development.
44.	Branching prevents unstable code entering main branch.
45.	git branch lists available branches.
46.	git checkout switches branches.
47.	git switch is modern alternative to checkout.
48.	Branching enables parallel development.
49.	Short-lived branches reduce conflicts.
50.	Branch strategy is critical for teams.
________________________________________
🔹 Merging & Rebasing
51.	Merge combines changes from one branch into another.
52.	Merge creates a merge commit.
53.	Merge preserves full history.
54.	Rebase rewrites commit history.
55.	Rebase creates cleaner linear history.
56.	Rebase should not be used on shared branches.
57.	Merge conflicts occur when same code lines change.
58.	Conflicts must be resolved manually.
59.	Understanding conflicts is critical for DevOps.
60.	Choose merge or rebase based on team policy.
________________________________________
🔹 Remote Repositories
61.	Remote is a shared Git repository.
62.	git remote -v shows configured remotes.
63.	origin is default remote name.
64.	git fetch downloads changes without merging.
65.	git pull fetches and merges changes.
66.	git push uploads local commits to remote.
67.	Always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.
68.	Remote access uses HTTPS or SSH.
69.	SSH keys are preferred for security.
70.	Remote repositories enable CI/CD integration.
________________________________________
🔹 Undo & Recovery
71.	git log shows commit history.
72.	git diff shows code differences.
73.	git reset moves HEAD to another commit.
74.	Soft reset keeps changes staged.
75.	Hard reset discards changes permanently.
76.	git revert creates new commit to undo changes.
77.	Revert is safer for shared branches.
78.	Git allows recovering deleted commits.
79.	Never panic when mistakes happen in Git.
80.	Git history helps disaster recovery.
________________________________________
🔹 Tags & Releases
81.	Tags mark important commits like releases.
82.	Lightweight tags are simple references.
83.	Annotated tags store metadata.
84.	Tags are used for versioning.
85.	CI/CD pipelines often trigger on tags.
86.	Tags make rollback easier.
87.	Release management depends on tags.
88.	Tag naming should follow standards.
89.	Tags should be immutable.
90.	Production deployments often use tags.

🔹 Git in DevOps & Best Practices
91.	Git is the starting point of CI/CD pipelines.
92.	Every pipeline begins with code checkout.
93.	Git history provides audit trail.
94.	Code reviews improve quality and security.
95.	Pull requests enforce collaboration.
96.	Protect main branch from direct commits.
97.	Automation depends on clean Git workflows.
98.	Git integrates with all DevOps tools.
