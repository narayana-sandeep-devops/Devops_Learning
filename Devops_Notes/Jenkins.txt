--> First PIPELINE
- workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/firstpipeline

--> Master - Slave Architecture
    - Jenkins follow the master slave architecture.
    - Master Node: Work like a container
    - Worker Node: Slave/Worker node will work as a Execution Node
    - Single Master Node can have Multiple Worker node
    - Master Controls the Load Distributeion on Slave Nodes.
        - Jenkins installation is not required on slave node. only java installation is enough.
        - we attach windwos/linux/mac os slave node to any os master node.
    - Master Node:-
        - Schedule Build job
        - Dispatch Build Execution to Slave Node
        - Monitor Slave and Record the build result
    - Slave Node:
        - Execute Build dispatched by Master

--> Jenkins User Management:
- we can control access for pipelines and other options.
- we can give read/write access by using user management.
- Role based authentication plugin needs to install to use thie features.
- after installing plugin, need to enable "Role-based Strategy" nder security -> Authorization
